# ShadowCode 🐍 - Python Typing Trainer

A muscle-memory coding gym that teaches Python syntax before stress, confidence before complexity, and fluency before logic.

## What is ShadowCode?

ShadowCode is a typing-based Python coding trainer where learners don't read code first — they physically write it into muscle memory by typing over a transparent "ghost".

**Not tutorials. Not videos. Not copy-paste. Embodied coding.**

## How it works

1. **Ghost Code Layer**: Predefined Python code snippet appears faded and uneditable
2. **Live Typing Layer**: You type directly on top of the ghost code
3. **Accuracy Engine**: Tracks character accuracy and completion rate (speed is secondary)
4. **Progression System**: Start with simple statements, advance to complex code

## Current Features

- Beginner Python level with `print()` statement
- Real-time typing overlay
- Dark theme optimized for coding
- No copy-paste restrictions
- Auto-focus for immediate practice

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5175 and start typing the Python shadow!

## Philosophy

You don't learn Python by thinking first. You learn it by typing it correctly, repeatedly, under calm pressure — just like musicians rehearse scales or fighters drill combinations.

## Future Roadmap

- Multiple difficulty levels
- Various Python constructs (loops, functions, classes)
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Leaderboards and achievements
- Support for other programming languages

## Tech Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Modern CSS with inline styles

**ShadowCode comes before tutorials. Before frameworks. It's the warm-up dojo for Python developers.**
